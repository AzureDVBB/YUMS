# The source of it all

Hello, brave traveller.

---

Welcome to the simple yet complex MUD server source code! In order to run this beast look no further then the `run_server.py`, now that works however database operations will fail if there are no local Mongo DB servers running on the default address.

For fresh Databases please run `example_world.py` to populate the database with a world to walk around in. (things break on empty databases) This is just a copy of `src/mud/_study/mongo db/BasicZoneLayoutInsertion/tutorial.py` so it is actually findeable.

However should you choose to delve deeper, there will be `README.md` files like this one to help guide your path. 

Good luck!
