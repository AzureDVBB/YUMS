# The source of it all

Hello, brave traveller.

Welcome to the simple yet complex MUD server source code! In order to run this beast look no further then the `run_server.py`, yes it's that simple.

However should you choose to delve deeper, there will be `README.md` files like this one to help guide your path. 

Good luck!
