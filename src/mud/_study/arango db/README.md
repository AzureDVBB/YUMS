# ArangoDB
ArangoDB is a native multi-model database that scales. It is storing data mostly in a json format so it is highly flexible and an in-built mechanism to validate Json schemas if necessary.

For this versatility it is a good candidate to be the backbone of any game project and in this folder I prototype several ways of using it and see if it lives up to the reputation.

For more information on the database, read its documentation at <https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/>

The database driver for python I will use is `python-arango` which can be found at <https://github.com/joowani/python-arango>
