Relative and Absolute are important for a more structured package/subpackage layout,
as well as removing the need to have to copy and duplicate code allready present.

In our use case, importing classes from other modules and subpackages from the overall package,
to use as typehints.

There are a few caveats with this style of importing:

1, you can only do it if you have packages
2, it will only work (from my experience) if you are outside the top-level package
and are importing the whole lot, otherwise the top-level package will be named __main__ and
subsequently importing from the top-level package, fails

Thus in order for the relative and absolute imports to work properly, and run the package...
the running script needs to be outside the package and import it as such to then run.
