# _Study?

Welcome to the experiments and sketches!

This folder is here to have a glimpse of some experiments, studies and sketches I have made during the development of this MUD server. 

Each folder has a verbose name, each module is heavily commented as a reminder for myself and several more complex ones even have an `explanation.txt` to rant out, and explain things of what and why I have done something.

Over time this place may be cleaned up, organized better and have a `README.md` like this one, however that is really not a priority.

If there are new and experimental ideas, they will go here first and foremost, as proofs of concepts.

It is recommended that you, the reader, also play around with ideas in a similar folder, testing and experimenting with it before implementing changes to a working bit of code, completely breaking it. (yes, talking from experience)
