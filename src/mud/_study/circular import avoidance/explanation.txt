To help with development and enable tab completion in our IDE's of choice, type hinting is near
essential tool to inform said IDE about the object and its methods.

To facilitate this even in classes that import eachother, would cause Circular Import Errors.

Avoiding this is a simple case of 'burying' the import inside the class initialization code
so it does not cause circular import errors.

Simple fix really, but now allows tab completion in IDE which is incredibly useful.
